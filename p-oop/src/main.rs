    // === Encapsulation ===
    // Rust has the pub keyword to allow external code to access some functions,
    // attributes and even a full struct of some structure/module

    // === Inheritance ===
    // Rust does not support inheritance directly.
    // In Rust, there's other solutions to that, like default implementations
    // of a trait.

    // === Polymorphism ===
    // Rust instead uses generics to abstract over different possible types and
    // trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide

    // === Trait for Values of Different Types ===
